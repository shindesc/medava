Your questions here.

1. What exactly does the statement package edu.uc.cs3003.medava; do? Does it function like the #include xyz; statements in C++?
2. Does the @Override method have an equivalent in C or C++?
3. I have previously worked with creating simulations using C++ and this assignment uses Java. Both are OOP languages. Is it true that OOP languages are good for creating simulations? If yes, why?
4. 
package edu.uc.cs3003.medava;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

Does the statement specifying the package have to come before the import statements?
And does the order of the import statements matter?

5. In Transporter.java, what if the item is 'null' when unload() is called?
6. Is this simulation realistic enough for real-world applications? Are simulations having real-life applications typically more complex or less complex than this one?
